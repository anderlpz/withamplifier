## The Parallel

**Wabi's angle:** "Apps are one-size-fits-all. What if they were personal?"

**Amplifier's angle:** "What if you could CREATE those personal apps yourself?"

Wabi is the *vision* of personal software. Amplifier is the *means* to get there.

## The Cree-sumer Frame

Right now, to build software you need:
- Engineers
- Designers  
- Product managers
- DevOps
- Months of work
- Millions of dollars

What if you just needed... an idea and a conversation?

That's the world Amplifier unlocks. Not "there's an app for that" but **"I can make an app for that."**

---

## Potential Placement

- **/manifesto** - The philosophical "why" (Wabi-style poetic prose)
- **/creators** - Speaking to the person who has ideas but not a dev team
- **/future** - What becomes possible when everyone can create

The homepage speaks to what Amplifier IS. This would speak to what Amplifier MEANS.

## Draft Cadence (Wabi-style)

```
For decades, software was something you used.
Made by others. For the masses.

But year after year, our tools remain largely the same.
Visions of personal productivity gave way to a new bundle.
A dozen apps produced by a handful of mega-corporations.

What if software was something you made?
Not just another tool for that...
But this time, a tool by you.
```

## Key Themes from Wabi to Adapt

- One idea per breath
- Sets up the problem before the solution
- Personal ("Not for us" → "for you" → "by you")
- Poetic without being pretentious
- The reveal comes late
