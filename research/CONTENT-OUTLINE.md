## VOICE & TONE

**Primary Voice:** Sam Schillace style — insider confidant who respects your intelligence, acknowledges uncertainty, but wants to make sure you don't miss what's actually happening.

**Characteristics:**
- Conversational, not corporate
- Uses "folks" not "users"
- Hedges with "seems," "likely" — confident but not arrogant
- Acknowledges messiness and complexity
- Grounds observations in timelines ("6 months ago... now...")
- Connects to broader patterns ("this feels like the early web")

**Headline Flow:** Headlines should read as one continuous thought when scanned:

```
Something is changing.
↓
Most tools won't let you see inside.
↓
So we made everything swappable.
↓
Here's what that looks like.
↓
The return compounds.
↓
What works spreads.
↓
If you're curious, try it.
```

### Section 1.1: Hero
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Something is changing." |
| **Subhead** | "The folks building serious things with AI want to see inside, swap pieces, make it theirs. That's what Amplifier is for." |
| **CTA** | `pip install amplifier` (code block) |
| **Visual** | Gradient orbs (CSS), warm cream background |

---

### Section 1.2: The Problem
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Most tools won't let you see inside." |
| **Layout** | 3-column grid |

**Pain Points:**
1. **You can't see why** — "When something goes wrong, you're guessing. No visibility into decisions, prompts, or tool calls."
2. **You can't change anything** — "Want a different model? Different tools? You're stuck with what they decided to give you."
3. **You can't make it yours** — "Generic instructions. Generic personality. No way to encode how you actually work."

---

### Section 1.3: The Architecture
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "So we made everything swappable." |
| **Subhead** | "Providers, tools, and behaviors snap together into bundles. Change one piece without touching the rest." |
| **Layout** | 3 tiles + 1 centered card |

**Building Blocks:**

| Block | Description | Code Example |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Providers** | "The brain. Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, or run your own local model. Switch between them without changing anything else." | `providers: [anthropic, ollama]` |
| **Tools** | "The hands. Filesystem access, bash commands, web search, GitHub integration. Add only what you need." | `tools: [filesystem, bash, grep]` |
| **Behaviors** | "The personality. Instructions, expertise, and guardrails that shape how it works. Your workflow, encoded." | `behaviors: [security-focused]` |
| **Bundle** | "Combine providers + tools + behaviors into a shareable package. Install someone else's bundle, or publish your own." | (no code) |

---

### Section 1.4: Demo
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Here's what that looks like." |
| **Subhead** | "One command loads a bundle, connects to a model, and gets to work." |
| **Visual** | Terminal simulation |
| **CTA** | "Try more examples" → /explore |

**Terminal Content:**
```
$ amplifier run "Review this PR for security issues"

→ Loading bundle: security-reviewer
→ Provider: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
→ Tools: filesystem, grep, ast-analysis

◐ Analyzing changes in src/auth.py...
◐ Checking for common vulnerabilities...

⚠ Found 2 issues:

1. SQL Injection Risk (Line 47)

   → Use parameterized queries instead

2. Missing Input Validation (Line 23)
   password field accepts any length
   → Add length limits to prevent DoS

✓ Review complete. 2 issues found, 0 false positives.

**Questions:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What providers does Amplifier support? | "Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT-4), Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, and local models via Ollama. The provider is swappable—change it without rewriting your bundles." |
| Is Amplifier free? | "Amplifier is open source and free. You pay only for the AI providers you use (like Claude or GPT-4 API costs)." |
| What's the difference between Forge and CLI? | "Same capabilities, different interface. Forge is visual with guided learning and workspace management. CLI is terminal-based, scriptable, and fast. Choose what fits your workflow." |
| Can I create my own bundles? | "Yes. Bundles are YAML + markdown. Combine providers, tools, and behaviors to create capabilities specific to your work. Share them back to the community if you like." |
| How is this different from other AI tools? | "Most AI tools are monolithic—one interface, one capability. Amplifier is modular. Swap providers without rewriting. Add tools without permission. Build exactly what you need." |
