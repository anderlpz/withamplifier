# Content & Tone Guide

Amplifier's voice and writing standards for withamplifier.com and all brand communications.

---

## 1. Voice Characteristics

Amplifier speaks like a **thoughtful senior engineer** sharing something they've built—not a marketer, not a newsletter essayist, not a corporate spokesperson.

| Trait | What It Means | How It Sounds |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Precise** | Say exactly what it does, not what it might represent | "Swap providers without changing your bundle" not "Unlock infinite possibilities" |
| **Confident** | We know what we built and why it matters | "Bundles are portable" not "Bundles seem to be portable" |
| **Respectful** | Assume technical competence, don't over-explain | "Requires Python 3.10+" not "Make sure you have Python installed on your computer" |
| **Direct** | Lead with the point, not the journey to the point | "Debug every decision" not "Ever wondered what your AI is thinking?" |
| **Warm** | Approachable without being casual or cute | "Your workflow, encoded" not "Let's build something amazing together!" |

### What We Sound Like

> **Architecture section:** "Providers, tools, and behaviors snap together into bundles. Change one piece without touching the rest."

> **Benefit statement:** "See every prompt, every tool call, every decision. When something goes wrong, you can trace exactly why."

> **CTA:** "Install Amplifier and run your first command in under a minute."

### What We Don't Sound Like

> ❌ "Something is changing in the world of AI..." (Editorial/essay)
> ❌ "Unleash the full power of AI with our revolutionary platform!" (Marketing hype)
> ❌ "We're super excited to share this with you!" (Overly casual)
> ❌ "In a world where AI tools are increasingly important..." (Corporate preamble)

## 2. Tone Spectrum

Voice stays constant. Tone shifts based on context.

```
INSPIRING ←————————————————————————————————————————→ PRECISE
   │                                                      │
   Homepage Hero                            CLI Reference
   Vision statements                        Error messages
   "Why this matters"                       API documentation
```

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Homepage hero** | Inspiring, confident | "Build AI agents you can see inside, take apart, and make your own." |
| **Feature sections** | Clear, demonstrative | "Providers connect to models. Tools give agents capabilities. Bundles package them together." |
| **Documentation** | Direct, instructional | "Run `amplifier provider add anthropic` and enter your API key when prompted." |
| **Error messages** | Helpful, specific | "Provider 'anthropic' not configured. Run `amplifier provider add anthropic` to set up." |
| **Release notes** | Factual, concise | "Recipe context now flows between steps. Fixes #342." |

### Tone by Page

| Page | Primary Tone | Secondary Tone |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Home** | Confident clarity | Understated inspiration |
| **Explore** | Demonstrative | Inviting |
| **Build** | Instructional | Supportive |
| **Updates** | Factual | Appreciative |
| **Support** | Helpful | Patient |

## 3. Writing Principles

### DO

| Principle | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Lead with the capability** | Start with what users can do, not with context or philosophy |
| **Use concrete nouns** | "providers, tools, bundles" not "components, elements, pieces" |
| **Show, then explain** | Code example or demo first, explanation second |
| **Be specific** | "Six providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama" not "Many providers" |
| **Use active voice** | "Bundles package your setup" not "Your setup is packaged by bundles" |
| **Respect scanning** | Front-load key information; put the most important word first |
| **Use parallel structure** | "Install. Configure. Run." not "Installing, configuration, and running" |

### DON'T

| Anti-pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Rhetorical questions** | "Ever wondered why your AI made that choice?" feels manipulative |
| **Hype words** | "Revolutionary, powerful, amazing, game-changing" are content-free |
| **Journey framing** | "Something is changing" delays the point; readers leave |
| **Hedge words** | "Seems, probably, might, could potentially" undermine confidence |
| **Insider tone** | "Here's the thing most people miss..." creates artificial exclusivity |
| **Superlatives** | "The most modular framework" invites skepticism |
| **Future tense promises** | "You'll be able to..." is weaker than "You can..." |

## 4. Example Transformations

### Headlines

| ❌ Don't Write | ✅ Write Instead | Why |
|----------------|------------------|-----|
| "Something is changing." | "AI agents you can see inside." | Leads with capability, not mood |
| "Most tools won't let you see inside." | "Full visibility into every decision." | States the positive, not the problem first |
| "So we made everything swappable." | "Swap any piece without breaking the rest." | Active, specific, shows the benefit |
| "The return compounds." | "Your investment in learning compounds." | More concrete; "the return" is vague |
| "If you're curious, try it." | "Install in under a minute." | Action-oriented, removes conditional |

### Body Copy

| ❌ Don't Write | ✅ Write Instead |
|----------------|------------------|
| "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI development, developers are increasingly looking for tools that give them more control." | "Developers building with AI want to see inside, swap pieces, and make it theirs." |
| "Amplifier represents a paradigm shift in how we think about AI agent architecture." | "Amplifier is a modular framework for building AI agents." |
| "We believe that the future of AI belongs to those who can truly understand and customize their tools." | "When you can see every decision, you can debug with confidence." |

### CTAs

| ❌ Don't Write | ✅ Write Instead |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Start your journey" | "Get started" |
| "Discover the power of modularity" | "See how bundles work" |
| "Join the revolution" | "View on GitHub" |
| "Unlock your potential" | "Try the code reviewer" |

### Error States

| ❌ Don't Write | ✅ Write Instead |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Oops! Something went wrong." | "Connection failed: API key not found." |
| "We couldn't find what you're looking for." | "No bundles match 'securty'. Did you mean 'security-reviewer'?" |
| "Please try again later." | "Rate limit exceeded. Retry in 30 seconds." |

## 5. Headline Style

Headlines should be **declarative statements** that communicate capability or benefit. They are not narrative—they don't need to tell a story when read in sequence.

### Formula Options

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **[Verb] + [what]** | "Swap providers without rewriting code." |
| **[Noun] + [that/you can] + [benefit]** | "Agents you can see inside." |
| **[Adjective] + [noun] + [outcome]** | "Modular architecture. Portable bundles." |
| **[Imperative]** | "Debug every decision." |

### Section Headlines for Homepage

| Section | Old (Rejected) | New (Recommended) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Hero** | "Something is changing." | "AI agents you can see inside, take apart, and make your own." |
| **Problem** | "Most tools won't let you see inside." | "Visibility. Modularity. Control." |
| **Architecture** | "So we made everything swappable." | "Three building blocks. Infinite combinations." |
| **Demo** | "Here's what that looks like." | "Watch it work." |
| **Benefits** | "The return compounds." | "Control that compounds." |
| **Ecosystem** | "What works spreads." | "Bundles built by the community." |
| **CTA** | "If you're curious, try it." | "Start building." |

### Headline Hierarchy

```
H1 (Hero):     Ambitious statement of what Amplifier enables
               "AI agents you can see inside, take apart, and make your own."

H2 (Sections): Specific capability or benefit
               "Three building blocks. Infinite combinations."

H3 (Cards):    Feature name or action
               "Debug with confidence"

Eyebrow:       Context label, not a sentence
               "Why this matters" / "How it works" / "Get started"
```

## 6. Terminology

Use these terms consistently across all content.

| Use | Don't Use | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Bundle | Profile, package, collection | The correct term for Amplifier's composable units |
| Provider | Backend, service, connector | LLM connections (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) |
| Tool | Action, function, capability | Agent capabilities (filesystem, bash, etc.) |
| Hook | Event, listener, observer | Lifecycle observation points |
| Agent | Bot, assistant | Specialized personas within bundles |
| Module | Component, element | Generic term for any Provider/Tool/Hook |

### Phrases to Use

- "swap providers" (not "change backends")
- "bundle configuration" (not "setup file")
- "tool calls" (not "function invocations")
- "runs locally" (not "on-premises" or "self-hosted")

---

## 7. Content Patterns by Type

### Feature Description Pattern

```
[What it is] + [What you can do with it] + [Why that matters]

Example:
"Providers connect Amplifier to language models.
Swap between Claude, GPT-4, or local models without changing your bundles.
Your investment in prompts and tools transfers across providers."
```

### Benefit Statement Pattern

```
[Concrete capability] + [Resulting outcome]

Example:
"See every prompt, every tool call, every decision.
When something goes wrong, you can trace exactly why."
```

### Tutorial Step Pattern

```
[Number]. [Action verb] + [Object]
   [Code block]
   [One-line explanation if needed]

Example:
2. Add a provider
   $ amplifier provider add anthropic
   Enter your API key when prompted.
```

## 8. Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify content against these criteria:

- [ ] **Leads with capability**, not context or philosophy
- [ ] **No rhetorical questions** in headlines or opening lines
- [ ] **No hype words**: revolutionary, powerful, amazing, game-changing, unleash, unlock
- [ ] **No hedge words**: seems, probably, might, perhaps (unless genuinely uncertain)

- [ ] **Active voice** throughout
- [ ] **Correct terminology**: bundle, provider, tool, hook
- [ ] **Scannable**: key information front-loaded in each paragraph
- [ ] **Appropriate tone** for context (homepage vs docs vs errors)
